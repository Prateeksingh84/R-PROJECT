# 🧬 Cancer Cell Detection Using Python

This project applies **machine learning techniques** to detect cancer cells from biomedical image datasets. It combines **image processing**, **data preprocessing**, and **predictive modeling** to assist in automating cancer diagnosis.

## 🔍 Project Objective

To build an efficient, ML-based solution that classifies biomedical images as cancerous or non-cancerous, thereby aiding early and accurate medical diagnoses.

## 🚀 Features

- 📊 Data preprocessing (resizing, normalization, encoding)
- 🧠 Supervised learning models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, etc.
- 📈 Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix
- 🖼️ Image input and feature extraction using OpenCV
- 📉 Visualization of model performance with Matplotlib & Seaborn

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:**  
  - `NumPy`, `Pandas` – Data manipulation  
  - `OpenCV` – Image processing  
  - `scikit-learn` – ML algorithms  
  - `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn` – Data visualization
